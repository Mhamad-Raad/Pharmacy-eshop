# Pharmacy-eshop

this is an online shop that brings two users together which are (Customer, Pharmacist)
the pharmacist can upload/delete medicines where customer can buy it.
when a customer orders a medicine it goes to their notfication page also to the pharmacists notfication page.
the pharmacist can accept or decline order when the customer orders and get notified.
I have used java jsp,servelet and jstl in this web application.
and the system architecture is mvc (Module View Controller) architecture.
where the modules are users, medicines, and the notfications.
the view is the jsp which is the user interface
the controller is a servers.
I hope you like it <3
